## Agile Methodology
### Overview
In the GoodNewsBlog development stages, the Agile methodology was used to manage development through iterative and incremental progress. Key features like the comment section, profile updates, and post interactions were implemented in short sprints, allowing for continuous improvement and feedback. Each iteration focused on adding specific functionalities, such as enabling users to post blogs or add comments, ensuring that the project evolved incrementally. Collaboration, regular feedback, and adaptability were prioritized, ensuring that the project could be adjusted based on user needs and technical requirements as it progressed.

### GitHub Projects
I created 5 seperate GitHub project boards for this project, one to represent each iteration. Each project includes issues for each iteration, with all tasks attached to the issue, so I could check off the task boxes when completing a new task.

##### Iteration 1 
![Screenshot of kanban board iteration 1](docs/readme-md/board-iteration-one.png)

##### Iteration 2
![Screenshot of kanban board iteration 2](docs/readme-md/board-iteration-2.png)

##### Iteration 3

##### Iteration 4

##### Iteration 5 
![Screenshot of kanban board iteration 5](docs/readme-md/board-iteration-5.png)

### Epics
The epics/iterations for this project were divided into stages of development, trying to prioritise the most important tasks first and leaving the testing and validation for the final iteration. I tried my best to keep the most relevant user stories grouped together when planning the iterations and I included a brief description of each epic on my projects. (link projects page)

#### Iteration 1 :
Create core functionality, superuser, and administrator tasks.

#### Iteration 2 :
Create register, login, logout functionality with basic structure added to HTML Templates.
[Link to full Kanban Board with all issues included in this Iteration](https://github.com/users/FernVR/projects/3)

#### Iteration 3 :
Creating basic functionality on home page, blog posts page and about page. (Comments, add posts, likes, forms).

#### Iteration 4 :
Style/polish all views.

#### Iteration 5 :

### User Stories
The issues/ user stories were broken down into different categories, developer, visitor, registered-user and admin user stories. This was to separate concerns and ensure that all user functionality was being added. I added personalised labels to the issues so I could see which categories each issue was separated into, and how many from each section I was still working on to complete. 
![Screenshot example of different issues with different labels.](docs/readme-md/issues-labels.png)

## Wireframes
I used Figma to create basic wireframes for standard screensizes:

## Database Schema
I used Lucid Chart to create basic Entity Relationship Diagrams for database schema:
- Note : I ended up deleting like model, view and urls because it was causing errors I couldn't fix, like model is included in ERD for future features purposes.

![Screenshot of ERDS](docs/readme-md/pp4-ERD.png)

## Design and Layout
### Typography

Inika Font is a serif typeface designed with elegance and readability in mind. Its soft, well-balanced letterforms make it ideal for both print and digital platforms. I decided to use this font for:
- Readability: The serif design enhances legibility, especially in longer articles, making it perfect for news content.
- Professional Aesthetic: Inika has a formal yet approachable look, adding credibility to journalistic content.
- Versatility: It works well on various screen sizes, providing a consistent reading experience on mobile and desktop.
- Distinctive Style: Its unique design helps a news blog stand out while maintaining a polished appearance.
### Colour Scheme
![Screenshot of Colour schemes](docs/readme-md/colour-pallete.png)

### Images
I tried to carefully select the images to match the overall theme and aesthetic of the site. I tried to use complimenting colours where possible.

### Future Features
#### Likes 
- I attempted to create a like feature for this project but found myself running out of time before being able to fix the errors it was causing. I thought it was working ok until I tried to call the like/dislike buttons and caused a 500 error. Had I given myself a bit more time I would have definitely wanted to fix this issue and include it here. Would like to add this feature later in development.

#### Drafts / Edit Posts
- I have included a post list section of the user profile, so users can access and delete their added posts, but would later like to include an option for a user to be able to edit their posts too, whether they are approved or unnapproved.

#### Small/Medium text field for 'add user post' section
- I had an issue with using the summernote text editor as my content field for the add post section, the editor was too large for small/medium screens and was greatly pushing the content off the screen. I couldn't find a way to change the size of the editor/ include a different editor for smaller screens, but I would like to find a way to include this feature on small screens so the feature can be accessed by users on any device. ( This bug is recorded in the bug section of my Testing file, [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) )

### Code
* I took a lot of my inspiration for this project from the CI PP4 Walkthrough project that was also a blog. I used some of the models and view functions to create a basic structure and plan for my own functions, though I added a lot of different functionality.

* I took some inspiration from these youtube channels, as well as this documentation to help me learn django and implement different features:
