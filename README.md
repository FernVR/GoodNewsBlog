## Agile Methodology
### Overview
In the GoodNewsBlog development stages, the Agile methodology was used to manage development through iterative and incremental progress. Key features like the comment section, profile updates, and post interactions were implemented in short sprints, allowing for continuous improvement and feedback. Each iteration focused on adding specific functionalities, such as enabling users to post blogs or add comments, ensuring that the project evolved incrementally. Collaboration, regular feedback, and adaptability were prioritized, ensuring that the project could be adjusted based on user needs and technical requirements as it progressed.
### GitHub Projects
I created 5 seperate GitHub project boards for this project, one to represent each iteration. Each project includes issues for each iteration, with all tasks attached to the issue, so I could check off the task boxes when completing a new task.

##### Iteration 1

##### Iteration 2

##### Iteration 3

##### Iteration 4

##### Iteration 5

### Epics
The epics/iterations for this project were divided into stages of development, trying to prioritise the most important tasks first and leaving the testing and validation for the final iteration. I tried my best to keep the most relevant user stories grouped together when planning the iterations and I included a brief description of each epic on my projects. (link projects page)

#### Iteration 1 :
Create core functionality, superuser, and administrator tasks.

#### Iteration 2 :
Create register, login, logout functionality with basic structure added to HTML Templates.

#### Iteration 3 :
Creating basic functionality on home page, blog posts page and about page. (Comments, add posts, likes, forms).

#### Iteration 4 :
Style/polish all views.

#### Iteration 5 :
All Manual and Automated Testing tasks/issues for Good News Blog and all documentation tasks.

### User Stories
The issues/ user stories were broken down into different categories, developer, visitor, registered-user and admin user stories. This was to separate concerns and ensure that all user functionality was being added. I added personalised labels to the issues so I could see which categories each issue was separated into, and how many from each section I was still working on to complete.

* I took some inspiration from these youtube channels, as well as this documentation to help me learn django and implement different features:
